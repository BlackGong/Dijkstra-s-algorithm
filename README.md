# Dijkstra-s-algorithm

Implemented with min-Heap
Time Complexity O((N + E ) log N)

//sample screenshot
cost from 0 to 0 is: 0  from node is 0
cost from 0 to 1 is : 7  from node is 2
cost from 0 to 2 is : 4  from node is 0
cost from 0 to 3 is : 10  from node is 1
cost from 0 to 4 is : 14  from node is 3
cost from 0 to 5 is : 9  from node is 1
